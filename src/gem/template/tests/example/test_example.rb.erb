# TODO: remove this file and code. It exists solely as a reference to create your first test
# The test class below includes a single test which illustrates how you might automate the sign in process for a typical
# web application. Note that #setup is navigating to the home url. This should generally redirect a user to the sign in
# page. We confirm this is the case in the test by ensuring the `sign-in` view is visible.

class TestExample < BaseTest

  def setup
    super
    ui_steps.navigate_to_home
  end

  def test_sign_in
    view('sign-in').tap do |v|
      v.is_visible!
      v.text_field('email').enter_text('email@example.org')
      v.text_field('password').enter_text('password123')
      v.action('submit').activate
      v.is_not_visible!
